# Polkadot Appetizer - by AdMeta

## About

Project Name: Polkadot Appetizer

Team: AdMeta

Started in 10.2022

## Project Details

### Overview

Polkadot Appetizer is a tool built for new users of the Polkadot ecosystem, designed to provide guidance and a seamless transition for crypto rookies or experienced users of other ecosystems(e.g. Ethereum).

Polkadot Appetizer is powered by AdMeta Network. AdMeta is a Web3 advertisement platform that focuses on privacy-preserving. AdMeta uses a privacy-preserving DID (Decentralized Identity) service to identify target groups for advertisers. By using privacy protection solutions, AdMeta guarantees from a technical point of view that no user data is collected.

Unlike traditional ad platforms, who collect users sensitive data(e.g. location, browsing history) for advertising, AdMeta does not collect or store any user data per se. Instead, users voluntarily decide and control what data can be stored in TEE, and the stored data in TEE cannot be accessed by anyone except users themselves.
