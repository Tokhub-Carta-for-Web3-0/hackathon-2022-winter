### The Inspiration

Redirecting monetization opportunities to creators in their best interest in Web3 is the crux the industry has been longing to solve. Content is not truly owned by creators in most cases in Web3, most data is still being stored in centralized storage where the ownership issue prevails. VIDEOWN provides a platform where creators share and trade content with data ownership and privacy protection, bringing creators the unprecedented experience of content creation, sharing and trading in the world of Web3.

### **Project Introduction**
VIDEOWN is a decentralized video NFT platform, built on the CESS blockchain, to provide users a smooth video streaming experience. Users not only can upload, play or search for all tagged video content on VIDEOWN, but also mint the content as NFT. NFT is no longer just implemented in the form of smart contracts. VIDEOWN realized the concept that NFT is the data itself, and users can exchange data ownership, whether it is pictures, music or videos.
